Class:       Scanner, Scan_Result
Description: This class manages any functionality regarding scaning files, directories, or processes. 
             Anything found will be logged by the logger class. It is also expected that the scanner 
             returns a Scan Result Object, that will be used by the main driver program to decide
             how to handle and interpret the results.
