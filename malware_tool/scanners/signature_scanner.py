Class:       SignatureScanner
Description: This class is responsible for implmenting the sha 256
             signature based scanning functionality. This class inherits
             the parent scanner class, and utilizes the database_handler.
             The goal should be for this class to eventually output a 
             Scan_Result object to the DB.
